# Pet-My-Cats
Was the first time you touched a MAC when you decided to pursue `coding`? Are you me?
This game is meant for MAC noobies like us who just wants to learn useful mac shortcuts for mac, vscode, zoom, and slack.



## About the Game
This will be a typing game. There will be a prompt on what the shortcut will do, and if you press the right keys => You get to pet my cute cats. Lucky you!

## Tech Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## MVP 
- [x] Start screen with directions
- [x] Screen displaying what shortcut does
- [x] If correct, cat gets pet
- [x] If wrong, game stops, correct shortcut displayed, no pets.

noteable fixes:
-going from event.key to event.code because spacebar is an empty string
-reset function had to include the eventCode object to be set to all false
-coded the pressed keys to match the terms we normally know. meta left => command
" " => spacebar
-coded pressed keys to command-shift-a  instead of <!-- Ë› -->
