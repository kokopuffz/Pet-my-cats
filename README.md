# Pet-My-Cats
Was the first time you touched a MAC when you decided to pursue `coding`? Are you me?
This game is meant for MAC noobies like us who just wants to learn useful mac shortcuts for mac, vscode, zoom, and slack.



## About the Game
This will be a typing game. There will be a prompt on what the shortcut will do, and if you press the right keys => You get to pet my cute cats. Lucky you! 

***

## Tech Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

***


## MVP 
* Start screen with directions
* Screen displaying what shortcut does
* If correct, cat gets pet, goes to next prompt?
* If wrong, game stops, correct shortcut displayed, no pets.
